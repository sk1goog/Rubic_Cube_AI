# Rubic_Cube_AI
My first own AI project 
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

With this project, I would like to create an AI solution that trains a 
deep learning algorithm so that the finished model, the Rubic Cube, can 
solve from any position.

## Background

The Ruby Cube is a well-known puzzle that has fascinated millions of people 
and has inspired them to solve and think about. There are already a lot of 
algorithms that solve the Rubiks Cube, but it's also interesting to develop 
a solution where you don't know how it works but which gives the right result 
in the end. 

## How is it used?

The solution for this project will simply be used for playful purposes.
It was for me to be motivation and stimulation with a meaningful topic to 
deal with the topic of artificial intelligence and to carry it out on a practical 
example in order to gain deeper knowledge about it. 


## Data sources and AI methods
It is currently still completely unclear to me which deap learning algorithm I will 
use for the project. I think it makes sense to document the original rotations with 
the Ruby Cube and to arrange them according to the respective result of these turns 
and to give the model as training material. 

## Challenges

It would be enough for me first if the model found a solution for the puzzle. 
Of course, it would be even better if the solution was always achieved with 
the minimum necessary number of singles, which is the so-called Gods number. 
But I realise that enormous computing power and resources will be necessary for this 
but it is currently not available and that's why I'm satisfied with a simple 
solution first. 

## What next?

As a first step, I will continue to deal with the basics that are necessary to set 
up such a model. I.e. specifically, I will first continue to deal with learning the 
programming language Python and at the same time, I will acquire theory about the 
various deep learning algorithms and also try to get to know the corresponding 
frameworks available and familiarise myself with them. 

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the learning platform "Building AI" which has accompanied me many 
evenings with the corresponding course in recent weeks and has provided me with 
a lot of interesting questions.
