# Rubic_Cube_AI
My first own AI project 
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

With this project, I would like to create an AI solution that trains a 
deep learning algorithm so that the finished model, the Rubic Cube, can 
solve from any position.

## Background

The Ruby Cube is a well-known puzzle that has fascinated millions of people 
and has inspired them to solve and think about. There are already a lot of 
algorithms that solve the Rubiks Cube, but it's also interesting to develop 
a solution where you don't know how it works but which gives the right result 
in the end. 

## How is it used?

The solution for this project will simply be used for playful purposes.
It was for me to be motivation and stimulation with a meaningful topic to 
deal with the topic of artificial intelligence and to carry it out on a practical 
example in order to gain deeper knowledge about it. 


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
